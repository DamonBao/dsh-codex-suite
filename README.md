A suite of [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) plugins that brings **ChatGPT/OpenAI Codex models** and a **Codex-style conversation experience** to the DSH Web UI. Built against DSH `0.1.2-rc.1` (peer range `>=0.1.2-rc.1 <0.2.0`).

The repository is a pnpm monorepo containing two independent runtime plugins and one pure bundle package:

| Package | Kind | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [`@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider`](packages/codex-provider) | Runtime plugin | Registers the `openai-codex` provider with ChatGPT OAuth login, proactive token refresh, usage dashboard, proxy-aware networking, and a native Settings page. |
| [`@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui`](packages/conversation-ui) | Runtime plugin | Re-renders the Web chat as a Codex-style event stream: turn folding, semantic tool activity, streaming reveal, deliverables, and smooth viewport follow. |
| [`@jcy2387/dsh-suite`](packages/all) | Pure bundle | No runtime code — a single profile patch that installs both plugins at once. |

The two plugins are fully decoupled: the Conversation UI works with any model, and the Codex Provider works with the stock chat UI.

## Why this suite

**Codex Provider — reliable ChatGPT access without an API key**

- **ChatGPT OAuth, both flows.** Browser-based login with device-code fallback. Login failures are classified into secret-free, localized reasons (region restrictions, callback port conflicts, token exchange errors, network issues…) instead of raw stack traces.
- **IPv6 loopback callback bridge.** pi-ai's OAuth listener only binds IPv4; on IPv6-preferred hosts the suite transparently relays the loopback callback, so login still works.
- **Proactive token refresh.** Access tokens rotate ~5 minutes before expiry with retry backoff; a dead refresh token is detected precisely and surfaces as *reconnect required* instead of failing mid-stream.
- **Usage dashboard.** Plan type, credits, and primary/secondary rate-limit windows with used-percent bars and reset times, fetched from the account-scoped ChatGPT endpoint.
- **Proxy-aware networking.** Auto-detects environment and system proxies (macOS / Windows / Linux), routes only OpenAI traffic through them, keeps loopback direct, and exposes an explicit proxy mode (auto / environment / off).
- **Reliability-first defaults.** SSE transport by default (no partial-output duplication on WebSocket failure), 5-minute stream idle timeout, configurable retry policy.
- **Native Settings page** at *Settings → OpenAI Codex* with zh/en localization, live status, and a loopback-only RPC boundary — credentials never leave the Host.

**Conversation UI — the chat rendered like Codex CLI**

- **One ordered event stream.** Process updates, thinking, tool calls, retries, workflows, compaction, and commands appear in natural order within each turn.
- **Turn folding.** A turn starts with an elapsed timer and a thinking placeholder; once the final answer lands, the process section collapses automatically (expandable, with a durable *auto-expand thinking* preference).
- **Semantic tool icons.** Search, file read/edit, shell, database, web, skill, and agent tools each get a distinct icon so activity is scannable at a glance.
- **Two reveal modes.** `teleprompter` (default): instant snapshots gliding upward; `typewriter`: grapheme-safe progressive reveal. Three smoothing presets (`realtime` / `balanced` / `silky`) tune the cadence.
- **Smart viewport follow.** New content is followed within bounded scroll speeds; scrolling up releases the follow, returning to the bottom resumes it. Respects `prefers-reduced-motion` and degrades gracefully under low frame rates.
- **Deliverables card.** Each finished turn lists produced files and websites with added/removed line counts.

## Installation

Prerequisites: DeepSeek Harness (`dsh`) with the `web` profile, Node.js `^22.19 || >=24`, pnpm 11.

**Install the whole suite (recommended):**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @jcy2387/dsh-suite
dsh web
```

**Or install plugins individually:**

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider
dsh plugin --profile web add @jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui
dsh web
```

**Local development** — link a workspace package instead of the published one:

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$PWD/packages/codex-provider
dsh plugin --profile web add link:$PWD/packages/conversation-ui
dsh web
```

Install **either** the suite **or** the individual plugins in a given profile — not both copies of the same plugin. Coexistence does not crash (the suite mounts its plugins inside a nested loader group, which avoids duplicate loader entry ids), but a direct install and the suite's copy share one loader entry: removing either side from the bundle list of a *running* dsh process silently stops that plugin until the next restart. Restart dsh after any bundle-list change.

## Quick start

1. Install the suite (see above) and open the Web UI (`dsh web`).
2. Go to **Settings → OpenAI Codex**, click **Connect**, and choose **Browser login** (or **Device login** on a headless/remote machine). Complete the ChatGPT authorization.
3. Back in the chat, pick an `openai-codex` model in the model selector and start talking.
4. Optional: review the usage panel in the same settings page, and tune the conversation stream in **Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration**.

## Configuration

Both plugins are configured through the profile's `cordis.patch.yml` overlay; user-level preferences live in the Settings UI and persist across restarts.

**Codex Provider** (profile patch ID: `codex-provider`)

| Option | Values | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `transport` | `sse` \| `websocket` \| `websocket-cached` \| `auto` | `sse` | SSE avoids duplicating partial output if a stream fails late. |
| `streamIdleTimeoutMs` | positive integer | `300000` | Max idle interval while reading one response stream. |
| `timeoutMs` / `websocketConnectTimeoutMs` | positive integer | — | Optional request-level timeouts. |
| `retryPolicy` | retry policy object | built-in | Request retry behavior. |
| `credentialRef` | credential reference | `OPENAI_CODEX_OAUTH` | Harness credential slot holding the OAuth state. |
| `ipv6CallbackBridge` | boolean | `true` | Relay the OAuth loopback callback for IPv6-only hosts. |
| `proactiveRefresh` | boolean | `true` | Refresh tokens ahead of expiry. |
| `proxyMode` | `auto` \| `environment` \| `off` | `auto` | Restart-applied; also editable in the Settings page. |

**Conversation UI** (profile patch ID: `conversation-ui`)

| Option | Values | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `mode` | `teleprompter` \| `typewriter` | `teleprompter` | Reveal style of assistant content. |
| `preset` | `realtime` \| `balanced` \| `silky` | `balanced` | Smoothing cadence. |
| `revealCharsPerSec` | 5–200 | `80` | Typewriter reveal rate. |
| `scrollSpeedPxPerSec` | 1–200 | `48` | Deprecated compatibility field; DSH owns scrolling. |
| `maxScrollSpeedPxPerSec` | 1–2000 | `1000` | Deprecated compatibility field; DSH owns scrolling. |

To temporarily disable the Conversation UI without uninstalling it, apply the bundled [`conversation-ui-off.yml`](packages/conversation-ui/conversation-ui-off.yml) overlay:

```yaml
- id: conversation-ui
  disabled: true
```

### Settings surfaces

| Location | Controls |
| --- | --- |
| Settings → OpenAI Codex | Connect/disconnect account, login method, usage dashboard, proxy mode. |
| Settings → Plugins → Plugin configuration | Auto-expand thinking (live), plugin version, one-click update for npm installs. |

## Architecture

Each runtime plugin ships two halves:

- **Host half** (Node) — Cordis plugin: provider registration, OAuth lifecycle, networking, settings persistence. Loaded from the package root.
- **Web half** (browser) — React views discovered through the `dsh.client` manifest. The Codex Provider contributes the Settings section; the Conversation UI replaces the assistant node view and wraps tool rows.

The halves communicate through two narrow channels: an inline **boot-config global** (`window.__DSH_CONVERSATION_UI_CONFIG__`) injected into the served HTML carries validated plugin config to the browser, and the **authenticated Connection RPC** carries settings reads/writes back to the Host. Secrets (tokens, proxy URLs) never cross the RPC boundary.

## Development

Requirements: Node.js `^22.19.0 || >=24.0.0` and pnpm `11.7`.

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm run check        # typecheck + test + build + pack dry-run, same as CI
```

Per-package commands:

```sh
pnpm --filter @jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider check      # typecheck + test + build + publint
pnpm --filter @jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui typecheck
pnpm --filter @jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui test
pnpm --filter @jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui build
pnpm --dir packages/all pack --dry-run
```

Tests run on [vitest](https://vitest.dev) — 14 suites covering the OAuth state machine, token refresh, network/proxy detection, usage parsing, the settings controllers, and the streaming client views. Client tests resolve the installed published DSH packages (a small module-table stand-in instantiates the shipped browser factory bundles). CI verifies release tags match all three package versions and audits the published tarball contents, then runs a consumer smoke test that installs the packed tarballs into a scratch project (resolving the published peer ranges against the real registry) and imports every Node-side entry point.

### Release

Publishing is automated by the **Release** workflow ([`.github/workflows/release.yml`](.github/workflows/release.yml)), which runs whenever a GitHub Release is published. It requires the release tag to equal the shared version of all three packages (an optional `v` prefix is stripped), re-runs the full quality gates, packs the three tarballs, verifies the suite bundle no longer carries `workspace:` ranges, and publishes to npm in dependency order (provider → conversation UI → suite) with **provenance** via **OIDC trusted publishing** — no long-lived `NPM_TOKEN` secret is involved.

One-time setup: configure [trusted publishing](https://docs.npmjs.com/trusted-publishing) on npmjs.com for `@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider`, `@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui`, and `@jcy2387/dsh-suite`, each authorizing repository `DamonBao/dsh-codex-suite` with workflow `release.yml` (no environment).

Prereleases are published under channel dist-tags derived from the version: `0.1.2-alpha.4` → `alpha`, `0.1.2-rc.1` → `rc`, and a stable `0.2.0` → `latest`. The workflow is idempotent — a package whose version already exists on npm is skipped, so a re-run after a partial failure republishes only what is missing.

A typical release:

```sh
# bump the version in all three packages/*/package.json files, then:
pnpm run check
VERSION="$(node -p "require('./packages/codex-provider/package.json').version")"
git commit -am "release: $VERSION"
git tag "$VERSION"
git push origin main --tags
```

Then create and publish a GitHub Release for that tag. Dependabot checks GitHub Actions dependencies weekly; npm updates are limited to tooling dev-dependencies because the `@deepseek-ai/*` toolchain is deliberately pinned in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Browser login never completes** — the callback bridge listens on `127.0.0.1:1455`; make sure the port is free and the browser can reach loopback. The settings page classifies the exact failure (port conflict, timeout, state mismatch…).
- **Region not supported** — OpenAI rejects the login for unsupported regions; the settings page surfaces this as a distinct reason. A proxy (`proxyMode`) can change the egress route (restart required).
- **`reauth required` after some time** — the refresh token expired or was revoked (e.g. password change). Reconnect once from the settings page.
