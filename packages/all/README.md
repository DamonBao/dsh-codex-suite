A pure [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) bundle: it contains **no Host or Client runtime code** — just a `cordis.patch.yml` whose single profile patch installs two independent plugins together. Part of the [DSH Codex Suite](../../README.md) monorepo.

## What it installs

- [`@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider`](../codex-provider/README.md) — the Codex provider: ChatGPT OAuth, usage dashboard, proxy-aware networking, native Settings page.
- [`@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui`](../conversation-ui/README.en.md) — native DSH assistant reveal, auto-expanded thinking, and deliverables.

Both plugins remain independently configurable; the suite only wires them into the profile. To install or configure just one of them, install its package directly instead — but avoid keeping the suite and a standalone copy of the same plugin in one profile at the same time (see below).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @jcy2387/dsh-suite
dsh web
```

After installing, follow each plugin's quick start: connect a ChatGPT account in **Plugins → DSH Codex Suite → codex-provider**, then pick an `openai-codex` model — the conversation UI activates automatically for new conversations.

## How the bundle works

The package's `dsh.bundle.patch` metadata points at `cordis.patch.yml`, which inserts the two plugin rows directly:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: codex-provider
      name: '@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider'
    - id: conversation-ui
      name: '@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui'
```

The plugin page lists these two components. Their ids and individual configuration stay the same as a standalone installation.

Install either the suite or the standalone bundles in a profile. Combining both declares duplicate loader entry ids and prevents startup. Restart dsh after changing the bundle list.

### Upgrading from the grouped suite

The `suite-plugins` group has been removed. Remove overlays targeting that group and configure `codex-provider` or `conversation-ui` directly. Existing plugin preferences, credentials, and session data remain unchanged.

## Development

The package has no build step; it only ships `cordis.patch.yml`, this README, and the license.

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/all pack --dry-run    # from the monorepo root
```

CI audits the published tarball to confirm it contains the patch and no runtime bundles. See the [monorepo README](../../README.md) for workspace-wide commands.
