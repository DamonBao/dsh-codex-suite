A pure [DeepSeek Harness](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness) (DSH) bundle: it contains **no Host or Client runtime code** — just a `cordis.patch.yml` whose single profile patch installs two independent plugins together. Part of the [DSH Codex Suite](../../README.md) monorepo.

## What it installs

- [`@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider`](../codex-provider/README.md) — the Codex provider: ChatGPT OAuth, usage dashboard, proxy-aware networking, native Settings page.
- [`@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui`](../conversation-ui/README.en.md) — the Codex-style conversation UI: event stream, turn folding, streaming reveal, deliverables.

Both plugins remain independently configurable; the suite only wires them into the profile. To install or configure just one of them, install its package directly instead — but avoid keeping the suite and a standalone copy of the same plugin in one profile at the same time (see below).

## Install

```sh
dsh plugin --profile web add @jcy2387/dsh-suite
dsh web
```

After installing, follow each plugin's quick start: connect a ChatGPT account in **Plugins → DSH Codex Suite → codex-provider**, then pick an `openai-codex` model — the conversation UI activates automatically for new conversations.

## How the bundle works

The package's `dsh.bundle.patch` metadata points at `cordis.patch.yml`, which inserts both plugins inside a nested loader group:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: suite-plugins
      name: cordis:group
      group: true
      config:
        - id: codex-provider
          name: '@jcy2387/dsh-codex-provider'
        - id: conversation-ui
          name: '@jcy2387/dsh-conversation-ui'
```

The nested group keeps the suite **crash-safe against coexistence**: the loader rejects two rows with the same id inside one group (the original `duplicate loader entry id` boot failure), but rows at different levels are allowed. If a profile also contains one of the plugins installed directly, the direct row and the suite's child row map onto one shared loader entry and the plugin runs exactly once.

**Coexistence caveat:** while both rows are present, removing either one (the suite or the direct install) from the bundle list of a *running* dsh process disposes that shared entry, and the plugin silently stops working until the next restart. The safest policy is to install either the suite **or** the standalone packages in a given profile, and to restart dsh after any bundle-list change.

## Development

The package has no build step; it only ships `cordis.patch.yml`, this README, and the license.

```sh
pnpm --dir packages/all pack --dry-run    # from the monorepo root
```

CI audits the published tarball to confirm it contains the patch and no runtime bundles. See the [monorepo README](../../README.md) for workspace-wide commands.
